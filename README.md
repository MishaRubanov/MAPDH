# Multidomain, Automated, Photopatterning of DNA-Functionalized Hydrogels
## Patterning functions for all-in-one scripting for use with **MAPDH**

Multidomain, Automated, Photopatterning of DNA-Functionalized Hydrogels (**MAPDH**) is a platform for the automated fabrication of DNA-functionalized hydrogels using digital, maskless photolithography. The preprint is coming out soon!

## Getting Started

To streamline MAPDH use, example scripts and functions for convenience are provided.

Key files in the main folder:
* Patterning_functions
  * This file contains all necessary functions to run all operations in MAPDH.
* Patterning_example_script
  * This file is an example that uses a few built-in masks to pattern differently shaped hydrogels
* MAPDH_example_script
  * This file is an example for fully automated MADPH - incorporating the flow controller, patterning setup, bright-field and fluorescence imaging into one script for multi-domain patterning and simultaneous imaging.
