# Multidomain, Automated, Photopatterning of DNA-Functionalized Hydrogels
## Patterning functions for all-in-one scripting for use with **MAPDH**

Multidomain, Automated, Photopatterning of DNA-Functionalized Hydrogels (**MAPDH**) is a platform for the automated fabrication of DNA-functionalized hydrogels using digital, maskless photolithography. The preprint is coming out soon!

## Getting Started

There are three key files in the main folder:
* Patterning_functions
** This file contains all necessary functions to run all operations in MAPDH.
* Patterning_example_script
** This file is an example that uses a few built-in masks to pattern differently shaped hydrogels
* MAPDH_example_script
** This file is an example for fully automated MADPH - incorporating the flow controller and patterning setup into one script.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
